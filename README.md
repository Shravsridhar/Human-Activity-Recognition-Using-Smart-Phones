Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Smart-Phones
•	Proposed a method for recognizing human activities using the sensors incorporated in smart phones
•	Performed feature selection and feature extraction using different strategies reducing 563 features to 21
•	Analyzed the most important features required for activity recognition and interpreted their role in classification problem 
•	Using python, implemented several algorithms and proposed a final SVM model post comparison
•	Hyper tuned parameters of SVM choosing radial kernel for the problem with best tradeoff between computational complexity
	and recognition accuracy
